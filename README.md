## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project, I got to apply my understanding in HTML and CSS. I learned that in building projects especially a website, I need to understand first how the HTML of the project should be written because it is the foundation of your website and without it, websites won't work as you intended it to be. I also learned that in styling your HTML, organization of styles is important in order for you to keep track of the styles you used.

### Continued development

I want to improve my organization skills in writing my HTML and CSS.
